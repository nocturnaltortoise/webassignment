				<h1>Biography</h1>
			
				<img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Me" />
				<p>
				My name is Charles Marlow and I'm a full time web developer/designer, and founder of Nocturnal Web Development. 
				I've been developing websites since the early days of the dotcom bubble, when I learnt how to code a black and white basic html page from a friend while between jobs. 
				I like to think my life experiences have given me a down-to-earth personality that allows me to relate to my clients so we can get things done. Originally from London, I spent time working with mineral extraction companies in what was then Zaire (now the DRC), but had to flee during the First Congo War in 1996. Since then, I have developed websites for a number of firms and charities, many of which seek to raise awareness about the problems faced by people living in war-torn developing regions like the Congo.
				So you could say I've graduated from the school of hard knocks. 
				I may not have the impressive gold-plated qualifications of some web developers, but I can promise you quality, a friendly face, and cheap prices!
				</p>
